# Binary search is done on a sorted list or a sorted array. 
# Binary search takes the length of the list (minus one) and divides it by two -- this becomes the check index. 
# If the value at the check index is less than our 'search for input' then that number becomes the new start of our index. 
# If the value at the check index value is more than our 'search for input' then that index becomes our end and the beginning is still the start index. 
# We use recursion until the number is either found or isn't found.

# The number of iterations required to reduce the search space to 1 element is logarithmic with respect to the number of elements in an array. At most it would take O(log(n)) iterations where n is the number of elements in an array

1. search space (n)
2. search space is (n/2)
3. search space is (n/4)

therefore drop the constant O(log(n))
