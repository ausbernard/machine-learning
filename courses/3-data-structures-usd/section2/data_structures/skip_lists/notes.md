In summation, we have now learned about the Skip List, a data structure based off of the Linked List that uses random number generation to mimic the binary search algorithm of a sorted Array List in order to achieve an average-case time complexity of O(log n). Also, we learned that, in order to achieve this average-case time complexity, we need to be smart about choosing a value of p: if p is too small or too big, we will effectively just have a regular Linked List, and as p grows, the memory usage of our Skip List grows with it. Once we have chosen a value of p, we should choose the maximum height of our Skip List to be roughly log(n) / log(1/p).
